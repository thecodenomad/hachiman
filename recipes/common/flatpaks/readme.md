Base:

This inclues default-flatpaks installed at the system level. This should be minimal, but should contain all of the
applications that I'd expect on a remote server, desktop, or laptop.


User:

This includes default-flatpaks installed at the user level. These are the rest of the expected apps that don't need
to be installed and enabled for every user. Maybe at somepoint Bluebird will enable per-user applications
which this should fall under depending on roles.

Communications:

This includes default-flatpaks installed at the user level. These relate to anything communication related (signal, fractal, etc)


Media:

This includes default-flatpaks installed at the user level that relate to media playback.


Studio:

This includes default-flatpaks installed at the user level that relate to media production (lmms, handbrake, makemkv, etc)
